# Revision History

[@P0848R0] was presented to EWG at the San Diego meeting (November 2018). It
proposed to change the rules for trivially copyable such that we only consider
the _best viable candidate_ amongst the copy constructors given a synthesized
overload resolution. That is, depending on `C<T>`, we either consider only `#2`
(because `#1` wouldn't be viable) or only `#1` (because it would be more
constrained than `#2` and hence a better match). However, EWG considered this to
be confusing as trivially copyable is a property of a type and adding overload
resolution simply adds more questions about context (e.g. do we consider
accessibility?). EWG requested a new mechanism to solve this problem.

[@P0848R1] was also presented to EWG in San Diego, proposed to introduce an
intermediate layer: a constructor for a class `X` of the form `X(X const&)`
rather than being considered a copy constructor would instead become a
_prospective copy constructor_, and a _copy constructor_ would be any
prospective copy constructor whose constraints are satisfied and is at least as
constrained as every other prospective copy constructor. In this way, we don't
change the definition of trivially copyable at all - we change the definition
for each of the special member functions.

During Core wording review in the Kona meeting (February 2019), a new direction
was suggested that is somewhat of a compromise between the two other positions:
we use the "constraints are satisfied and is at least as constrained as" rule on
the special member functions, but we only apply it to the trivially copyable
rules. This ensures that we maintain these as properties of the type rather than
properties of an expression - and is the direction this paper takes.

# Introduction

For a complete motivation for this proposal, see [@P0848R0]. In brief, it is
important for certain class template instantiations to propagate the triviality
from their template parameters - that is, we want `wrapper<T>` to be trivially
copyable if and only if `T` is copyable. In C++17, this is possible, yet is
extremely verbose. The introduction of Concepts provides a path to make this
propagation substantially easier to write, but the current definition of
trivially copyable doesn't quite suffice for what we want.

Consider:

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept C = /* ... */;

template <typename T>
struct X {
	// #1
	X(X const&) requires C<T> = default;
	
	// #2
	X(X const& ) { /* ... */ }
};
```

According to the current working draft, both `#1` and `#2` are copy
constructors. The current definition for trivially copyable requires that _each_
copy constructor be either deleted or trivial. That is, we always consider both
copy constructors, regardless of `T` and `C<T>`, and hence no instantation of
`X` is ever trivially copyable. 

This paper suggests that those specializations `X<T>` for which `T` satisfies
`C` should be considered trivially copyable - this very logically follows the
model of constraints and would make it substantially easier to write class
templates that are conditionally trivially copyable. Indeed, it would become
actually easy to do such a thing rather than quite complex with multiple layers
of conditional base classes. 

# Proposal

The current relevant definitions in [class.prop] read:

> A _trivially copyable class_ is a class:
> 
> - where each copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and
> move assignment operator ([class.copy.ctor], [class.copy.assign]) is either
> deleted or trivial,
> - that has at least one non-deleted copy constructor, move constructor, copy
> assignment operator, or move assignment operator, and
> - that has a trivial, non-deleted destructor.

> A _trivial class_ is a class that is trivially copyable and has one or more
> default constructors ([class.default.ctor]), all of which are either trivial
> or deleted and at least one of which is not deleted.

There are two aspects of these definitions that need to be changed for this
proposal: one that applies to five of the special member functions in the same
way (the copy and move constructors and assignment operators and the default
constructor), and one that applies specifically to the destructor.

For the five non-destructor special member functions, we introduce a new concept
called an _eligible special member function_ - which is a special member
function that is:

- not deleted
- has all of its constraints (if any) satisfied
- no special member function of the same kind, with the same first parameter
  type (except for the default constructor), is more constrained

And then simplify the definitions of _trivially copyable_ and _trivial_ to use
eligible special members instead of just any special members. 

For the destructor, we go in a slightly different direction. We introduce a
sub-classification called a _prospective destructor_ which is simply any
function declared for a class `X` that is spelled `~X()` with some constraints,
and then redefine destructor to be the eligible destructor, requiring that
there be only one. 

Using the example from R0:

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct optional {
	// #1
	optional(optional const&)
		requires TriviallyCopyConstructible<T> && CopyConstructible<T>
		= default;
		
	// #2
	optional(optional const& rhs)
			requires CopyConstructible<T>
	   : engaged(rhs.engaged)
	{
		if (engaged) {
			new (value) T(rhs.value);
		}
	}
};
``` 
    
For all specializations, we have two copy constructors: `#1` and `#2`. For
`T=unique_ptr<int>`, neither copy constructor has its constraints satisfied so
there is no eligible copy constructor. For `T=std::string`, only `#2` has its
constraints satisfied, so only `#2` is an eligible copy constructor. For
`T=int`, both `#1` and `#2` have their constraints satisfied. `#1` is more
constrained than `#2`, so only `#1` is an eligible copy constructor.

# Wording

Change 6.6.7 [class.temporary] to refer to the future definition of
eligibility:


> [3]{.pnum} When an object of class type X is passed to or returned from a function,
> if [each copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor of X is either trivial or deleted,]{.rm}
> [`X` has at least one one eligible copy or move constructor ([class.prop]),
> each such constructor is trivial, and the destructor of `X` is either trivial
> or deleted,]{.addu}
> implementations are permitted to
> create a temporary object to hold the function parameter or result object.
> The temporary object is constructed from the function argument or return
> value, respectively, and the function's parameter or return object is
> initialized as if by using the [non-deleted]{.rm} [eligible]{.addu} trivial
> constructor to copy the temporary (even if that constructor is inaccessible
> or would not be selected by overload resolution to perform a copy or move of
> the object). 

And likewise for 7.6.1.2 [expr.call]:

> [12]{.pnum} [...] Passing a potentially-evaluated argument of class type
> having a non-trivial [eligible]{.addu} copy constructor
> [([class.prop])]{.addu}, a non-trivial [eligible]{.addu} move constructor, or
> a non-trivial destructor, with no corresponding parameter, is
> conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics.

Change 9.4.2 [dcl.fct.def.default] to account for prospective destructors
that aren't destructors:

> [5]{.pnum} Explicitly-defaulted functions and implicitly-declared functions
> are collectively called _defaulted_ functions, and the implementation shall
> provide implicit definitions for them ([class.ctor], [class.dtor],
> [class.copy.ctor], [class.copy.assign]), which might mean defining them as
> deleted. [A defaulted prospective destructor ([class.dtor]) that is not a
> destructor is defined as deleted. A defaulted special member function
> that is neither a prospective destructor nor an eligible special member
> function ([class.prop]) is
> defined as deleted.]{.addu} A function is _user-provided_ if it is
> user-declared and not explicitly defaulted or deleted on its first
> declaration.

Insert at the beginning of 11.1 [class.prop] a definition of eligibility:

::: add
> [-1]{.pnum} Two special member functions are of the same kind if
>
> - [-1.1]{.pnum} they are both default constructors,
> - [-1.2]{.pnum} they are both copy or move constructors with the same first parameter type, or
> - [-1.3]{.pnum} they are both copy or move assignment operators with 
> the same first parameter type and the same *cv-qualifier*s
> and *ref-qualifier*, if any.

> [0]{.pnum} An _eligible special member function_ is a special member function
> ([special])
> 
> - [0.1]{.pnum} that is not deleted,
> - [0.2]{.pnum} where its associated constraints ([temp.constr]), if
> any, are satisfied, and
> - [0.3]{.pnum} where no special member function of the same
> kind is more constrained
> ([temp.constr.order]).
:::

Change the definitions of _trivially copyable_ and _trivial_ in 11.1
[class.prop] (this flips the first two bullet points):

> [1]{.pnum} A _trivially copyable class_ is a class:
> 
> - [1.0]{.pnum} [where each copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment
operator, and move assignment operator ([class.copy.ctor], [class.copy.assign])
is either deleted or trivial,]{.rm}
> - [1.1]{.pnum} that has at least one [non-deleted]{.rm} [eligible]{.addu}
> copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, or move
> assignment operator [([class.copy.ctor], [class.copy.assign])]{.addu}, [and]{.rm}
> - [1.2]{.pnum} [where each eligible copy constructor, move
> constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator
> is trivial, and]{.addu}
- [1.3]{.pnum} that has a trivial, non-deleted
> destructor.

> [2]{.pnum} A _trivial class_ is a class that is trivially copyable and has
> one or more [eligible]{.addu} default constructors ([class.default.ctor]),
> all of which are [trivial.]{.addu} [either trivial or deleted and at least
> one of which is not deleted.]{.rm}

Change 11.3.3 [special] to refer to prospective destructors, and make
everything plural:

> [1]{.pnum} [The default]{.rm} [Default]{.addu} constructor[s]{.addu}
> ([class.default.ctor]), copy constructor[s]{.addu}, move
> constructor[s]{.addu} ([class.copy.ctor]), copy assignment
> operator[s]{.addu}, move assignment operator[s]{.addu} ([class.copy.assign]),
> and [prospective]{.addu} destructor[s]{.addu} ([class.dtor]) are _special
> member functions_.

Change the definition of destructor as follows.

Change 11.3.6 [class.dtor]:

> [1]{.pnum} In a declaration of a [prospective]{.addu} destructor, the
> declarator is a function declarator (9.2.3.5) of the form [...] A
> [prospective]{.addu} destructor shall take no arguments (9.2.3.5). Each
> *decl-specifier* of the *decl-specifier-seq* of a [prospective]{.addu}
> destructor declaration (if any) shall be `friend`, `inline`, or `virtual`.

> [a]{.pnum} [At the end of the definition of a class, overload resolution is
> performed among the prospective destructors declared in that class with an
> empty argument list to select the _destructor_ for the class, also known as
> the _selected destructor_.
> The program is
> ill-formed if overload resolution fails. Destructor selection does not
> constitute a reference to ([dcl.fct.def.delete]) or odr-use ([basic.def.odr]) of
> the selected destructor, and in particular, the selected
> destructor may be deleted.]{.addu}

Change 11.3.6 [class.dtor]:

> [4]{.pnum} If a class has no user-declared [prospective]{.addu} destructor, a
> [prospective]{.addu} destructor is implicitly declared as defaulted (9.4). An
> implicitly-declared [prospective]{.addu} destructor is an inline public
> member of its class.

::: add
> An implicitly-declared prospective destructor for a class X will have the form
>
    ```cpp
    ~X()
	```
:::
    
Change 11.3.6 [class.dtor]:

> [10]{.pnum} A [prospective]{.addu} destructor can be declared `virtual`
> (11.6.2) or pure `virtual` (11.6.3)[; if]{.rm} [. If the destructor of a class is
> virtual and]{.addu} any objects of that class or any derived class are
> created in the program, the destructor shall be defined. If a class has a
> base class with a virtual destructor, its destructor (whether user- or
> implicitly-declared) is virtual.

Add to 13.8.2 [temp.explicit], immediately after paragraph 12:

> [12]{.pnum} An explicit instantiation definition that names a class template specialization explicitly instantiates the class template specialization and is an explicit instantiation definition of only those members that have been defined at the point of instantiation.
> 
> [12b]{.pnum} [An explicit instantiation of a prospective destructor shall name
> the selected destructor of the class.]{.addu}
