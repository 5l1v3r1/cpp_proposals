# Introduction and Motivation

Consider the following approach to trimming a `std::string`:

```cpp
auto trim(std::string const& s) {
    auto isalpha = [](unsigned char c){ return std::isalpha(c); };
    auto b = ranges::find_if(s, isalpha);
    auto e = ranges::find_if(s | views::reverse, isalpha).base();
    return subrange(b, e);
}
```

This is a fairly nice and, importantly, safe way to implement `trim`. The 
iterators `b` and `e` returned from `find_if` will not dangle, since they point
into the string `s` whose lifetime outlives the function. 

Except this code will not compile at the moment, either in C++20 or in
range-v3, failing on the declaration of `e`. The algorithm `find_if` is in
[alg.find]{.sref} is declared as:

```cpp
template<input_range R, class Proj = identity,
         indirect_unary_predicate<projected<iterator_t<R>, Proj>> Pred>
  constexpr safe_iterator_t<R>
    ranges::find_if(R&& r, Pred pred, Proj proj = {});
```

`R` will deduce as `reverse_view<ref_view<std::string const>>`, which does
_not_ satisfy `safe_range` (it is neither an lvalue reference, nor does
`reverse_view` currently opt-in to being a `safe_range`) hence the
return type `safe_iterator_t<R>` is the type `dangling` rather than being the
type `iterator_t<R>`. Instead of getting the reverse iterator we might have
expected, that we need to call `.base()` on, we get effectively nothing. We
are forced to rewrite the above as:

```cpp
auto trim(std::string const& s) {
    auto isalpha = [](unsigned char c){ return std::isalpha(c); };
    auto b = ranges::find_if(s, isalpha);
    auto reversed = s | views::reverse;
    auto e = ranges::find_if(reversed, isalpha).base();
    return subrange(b, e);
}
```

Which is an unnecessary code indirection. The goal of this paper is to make the
initial example just work. We clearly have a safe range that is not marked
as such, so I consider this to be a library defect. 

# History and Status Quo

Ranges introduced with it the concept _`forwarding-range`_. This was then
renamed to `safe_range` by [@P1870R1] in Belfast, but the core concept remains
the same. A range is a `safe_range` when you can safely hold onto its iterators
after the range goes out of scope. There are two kinds of safe ranges:

- lvalue references to ranges are always safe. It's not the lvalue reference
itself which owns the data, so if the reference dies, we're fine.
- ranges which must necessarily opt in to being considered safe, by way of the
new `enable_safe_range` variable template, which defaults to `false` for all
types.

There are several safe ranges which do this opt in today:

- `ref_view` is a safe_range. It's basically a reference - the iterators it
gives out are iterators to the range it refers to, which it has no ownership of.
If the `ref_view` dies, the referred to range can still be around.
- `string_view` is a safe range. Like `ref_view`, it just refers to data - the
iterators it gives out are iterators into some other containers. `span` and
`subrange` are similar.
- `empty_view` doesn't even have any data, so it's trivially safe. 
- `iota_view` works by having the iterators themselves own the "counter", so
having the iterators stick around is sufficient.

And that's it. We have six, _unconditionally_ safe ranges. All other ranges
and views in the standard library are _unconditionally_ unsafe. But this is
far too strict. As the opening example demonstrates, there are many more kinds
of safe ranges you can construct than _just_ the chosen six. 

This issue was first pointed out by Johel Ernesto Guerrero Pe√±a in [@stl2.640].

## Implementation Strategy

A range is going to be safe if its iterators do not in any way refer to it. For
the ranges in the working draft which are unconditionally safe, this follows
directly from how they actually work. But for some other ranges, it might
depend on implementation strategy. 

Consider `transform_view`. What it has to do is apply some unary function to
each element of the base view. Where does the function object live? It would
refer to the parent:

```cpp
struct transform_view<View, Fun>::iterator {
    iterator_t<View> base;
    Fun& projection;
};
```

or it could be owned by the iterator:

```cpp
struct transform_view<View, Fun>::iterator {
    iterator_t<View> base;
    Fun projection;
};
```

The former implementation strategy would not be safe, but the latter would. Which
to choose? The range-v3 implementation picks one or the other conditionally:

```cpp
template<typename T>
using semiregular_box_t = meta::if_c<(bool)semiregular<T>, T, semiregular_box<T>>;

template<typename T, bool IsConst = false>
using semiregular_box_ref_or_val_t = meta::if_c<
    (bool)semiregular<T>,
    meta::if_c<IsConst || std::is_empty<T>::value, T, reference_wrapper<T>>,
    reference_wrapper<
        meta::if_c<IsConst, semiregular_box<T> const, semiregular_box<T>>>>;

// in transform_view::iterator
semiregular_box_ref_or_val_t<Fun, IsConst> fun_;
```

`semiregular_box<T>` is basically an `optional<T>` that is invokable.

What this means is that:

- if `T` is not `semiregular`, the `transform_view` stores some kind of
`reference_wrapper` (to possibly-`const` `semiregular_box<T>`). This would
not be a safe range.
- if `T` is `semiregular`, but either `T` is not an empty type or the
`transform_view` is non-`const`, then the `transform_view` stores a
`reference_wrapper<T>`. This would not be a safe range either.
- if `T` is `semiregular` and either `T` is empty or the `transform_view` is
`const`, then we directly store a `T`. Such a range is safe.


We could then write:

```cpp
template <typename Rng, typename Fun>
inline constexpr bool enable_safe_range<transform_view<Rng, Fun>> =
    enable_safe_range<Rng> &&
    same_as<semiregular_box_ref_or_val_t<Fun>, T>;
```

Note that the template parameter of `enable_safe_range` has its cv qualifiers
stripped. In the range-v3 implementation, a `transform_view<Rng, Fun> const` could
be a safe range even if `Fun` were non-empty as long as it was `semiregular`.

But would we want to go this route? To do so, we would have to decide to either:

1. Mandate that `transform_view::iterator` stores a
`semiregular_box_ref_or_val_t<Fun, IsConst>` - which we currently do not specify.
The current description of in [range.transform]{.sref} is this:

::: bq
```cpp
template<class V, class F>
template<bool Const>
class transform_view<V, F>::iterator {
private:
    using @_Parent_@ =                             // exposition only
      conditional_t<Const, const transform_view, transform_view>;
    using @_Base_@   =                             // exposition only
      conditional_t<Const, const V, V>;
    iterator_t<@_Base_@> @*current_*@=                 // exposition only
      iterator_t<@_Base_@>();
    @_Parent_@* @*parent_*@ = nullptr;                 // exposition only
public:
    // ...
    
    constexpr decltype(auto) operator*() const
    { return invoke(*@*parent_*@->@*fun_*@, *@*current_*@); }    
    
    // ...
};
```
:::

That is, everything is exposition only and based on keeping a pointer into
the parent. The range-v3 implementation is a valid implementation strategy with
this specification - but not the only one.

2. Allow implementations to give different answers to the question of which
ranges are safe. That is, allow one vendor to ship range-v3 (in which some
`transform_view`s are safe ranges) and another to ship a direct translation of
the specification (in which no `transform_view`s are safe ranges).

3. Pick the most conservative option, and only mark those ranges as conditionally
safe for which there isn't much implementation freedom anyway.

And then we also need to decide if we want to allow `enable_safe_range<T>` and
`enable_safe_range<T const>` to give different results. In which we case, we
could add the following specialization:

```cpp
template <typename Rng, typename Fun>
inline constexpr bool enable_safe_range<transform_view<Rng, Fun> const> =
    enable_safe_range<Rng> &&
    same_as<semiregular_box_ref_or_val_t<Fun, true>, T>;
```

These are large design questions that are outside the scope of this paper - whose
goal is merely to identify those ranges that can be made conditionally safe
without having to delve into these questions. Thus, this paper by default picks
option #3.

# Proposal

Several range adapters semantically behave as if they have a single member of
some templated view type. If that underlying view type is a `safe_range`, the
range adapter itself can be transitively safe. For example, `s | views::reverse`
has the type `reverse_view<ref_view<string const>>`. This can be a `safe_range`
because `ref_view<string const>` is a `safe_range`. Likewise,
`s | views::reverse | views::take(3)` can also be a `safe_range` by extending
this logic further. 

Here is a table of all the range adapters and factories in the current working
draft, what their current `safe_range` status is, and what this paper proposes.

# Wording

}
```

# Implementation

This has been implemented in range-v3 [@range-v3.1405]. The PR includes the six
range adapters in this paper, along with a smattering of other range adapters
from range-v3 that can also be made conditionally safe in this manner (`const`,
`chunk`, `delimit`, `drop_exactly`, `indirect`, `intersperse`, `move`, `slice`,
`sliding`, `tail`, `trim`, `unbounded`, and `zip`) as well as a bunch of other
range adapters that can be additionally made conditionally safe based on both
the underlying range and the shape of invocables that they rely on (`group_by`,
all the `set_algorithm_view` adapters, `split_when`, `take_while`/`iter_take_while`,
`transform`, and `zip_view`/`iter_zip_view`).
